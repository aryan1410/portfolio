    st.markdown("""This project detects a user's facial expression in real-time and recommends music that matches their emotional state.
    It uses a VGG19-based convolutional neural network trained on the FER2013 dataset to classify emotions into categories like happiness,
    sadness, anger, and more. Haar cascades are employed for quick face detection, while OpenCV handles video processing. The system
    dynamically updates music playback as the user's emotions change, using Pygame for smooth, non-blocking audio control. The model
    is fine-tuned using transfer learning, with the final layers adapted for emotion classification. Overall, the project demonstrates
    a seamless integration of computer vision, deep learning, and user-centric media interaction.  
    Applications:  
    - Emotion-aware music players  
    - Mental wellness tools
